Palo alto checklist
This was for the 2020 Minnesota state qualifier. Seemed to work well enough. commit after major/important changes.
# = configure mode
1.	Change password
#	Set mgt-config users admin password
2.	Get rid of additional users
#	Delete mgt-config users administrator
3.	Download update to protect against CVE-2019-1580, and others...
>	Request system software check
>	Request system software download version 8.1.0
>	Request content upgrade check
Check download status after each step and download next version need to go out of configure mode for it, so a little annoying, 8.1.0 finished downloading after step 5 for me, 8.1.13 after step 6
>	Show jobs id <job id>
>	Request system software download version 8.1.13
>	Request content upgrade check
>	Request content upgrade download latest
>	Request content upgrade install version latest
//commits cannot be done until installs are finished, and a version install requires reboot, so you wont be able to commit until after a reboot has taken place
>	Request system software install version 8.1.13
> request restart system
//this will take down your services. It was done for exactly 6 mins during practice, around the same ammount of time for the competition
4.	Get rid of nat for palo, there was a NAT setup in the nat profiles allowing access to the management interface from a "public" IP
#	Delete rulebase nat rules PA
5.	Add new management profile, limit what services you can access on the interface because i cant figure out how to get rid of mgmt profiles on interfaces from cli, so limiting them until i get into the gui
#	Set network profiles interface-management-profile ping ping yes
6.	Remove management profile from interfaces
#	Set network interface ethernet ethernet1/1 layer3 interface-management-profile ping
#	Set network interface ethernet ethernet1/2 layer3 interface-management-profile ping
#	Set network interface ethernet ethernet1/3 layer3 interface-management-profile ping
#	Set network interface ethernet ethernet1/4 layer3 interface-management-profile ping
7.	Set management service settings, this will limit what services are going on your management interface
#	Set deviceconfig system service disable-http yes
#	Set deviceconfig system service disable-telnet yes
#	Set deviceconfig system service disable-snmp yes
#	Set deviceconfig system service disable-icmp yes
#	Set deviceconfig system service disable-ssh yes
8.	Hopefully you got a gui at this point, if so:
# commit
